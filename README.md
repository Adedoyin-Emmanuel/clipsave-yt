# Clipsave Youtube Downloader ðŸš€

[Use Clipsave](https://clipsavetest.vercel.app/app)

This repo is a simple tool to download youtube videos from **Clipsave**. The logic behind it is simple. I built **Clipsave** with **NextJs** but I really don't know why I'm getting a CORS error from one of my downloader **CDN** but I discovered it works well on plain **HTML, CSS and Javascript Sites** so yeah...
